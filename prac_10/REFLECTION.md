# My Reflection for Programming 2 

This will tell about my journey for Programming 2 practicals.

## Estimates for Practical Tasks

During the course of the subject, my average accuracy in estimating practical
is 3 out of 4. It was very easy to do for initial practicals because it was like
revising Programming 1. As the subject progressed, later practicals become difficult.
However, I could manage to do well by developing a better understanding of my own working
pace with gained experience with similar tasks. Overall, I reckon myself that
my accuracy in estimating practical tasks gradually improved.

## Code reviews

When I took on the role of a reviewer, I learnt to approach code from critical 
perspective, focusing on naming conventions, formatting, etc. By providing
constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement, I not only helped my folks
enhance their codes but also reinforced my own understanding of programming.

On the other hand, when my code was reviewed by others, I gained valuable feedback, 
such as insights into alternative approaches, identified potential bugs or vulnerabilities, 
and improvements on readability and maintainability. It was a humbling experience that reminded
me of the importance of good-quality code and the benefits of collaborating with others. 

## Practical Tasks 

Overall, the practicals in this subject were well-structured and provided opportunities for hands-on
learning. However, if I were in charge of the subject, I would consider a few changes in class practicals.
I rather put sample outputs for class practicals than instructions because I think it would be better for students to 
practice. This would help in developing a deeper understanding of the subject and creativity in problem-solving.

### Two examples of PRs

Here are two examples of PRs that show me doing good code reviews.

* [Example-1](https://github.com/ShweMoeThantAurum/CP1404Practicals/pull/5)
* [Example-2](https://github.com/ShweMoeThantAurum/CP1404Practicals/pull/1)
